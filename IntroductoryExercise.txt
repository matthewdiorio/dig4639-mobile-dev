Matthew Diorio, 
The app I am choosing is Snapchat. Snapchat allows for modifying images that are stored locally on the device. 
It displays for the user to select an image from their phone.
Then it takes the photo and displays that photo to the user in Snapchat. 
There are different inputs displayed to the user such as text, stickers, and filters. 
It takes that input and modifys the image based on the input
Then saves the modified image locally back on the phone.
